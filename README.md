# Software engineering project (second year project at ENSIMAG)

This project was carried out in groups of 5 students during the month of January 2022. The aim was to compile a new computer language named Deca inspired by Java. The purpose of this language is purely educational.

A big part of the work was to master the theory of languages. The understanding of the vocabulary and of the different grammar rules allowing to interpret the key words of the code and their actions was essential. We used the ANTLR tool to manage the vocabulary and grammar rules of the code.

A set of Java classes had to be developed to decorate the tree representing the Deca program. This decoration is used to know which actions (assembly code) the compiler must perform: display, loop, condition, declaration of variables, method or class ...

We used semi-agile working methods to be able to compile more and more developed subparts of the language by successive iterations. We started by implementing the basic principles of the language such as variable declaration, display functions, conditional statements ...

A lot of tests were necessary to verify that each new implementation could still compile the previous ones.

# Code

The source code of the final project is not publicly available because this emblematic project of the training will be proposed again next year at ENSIMAG.

Technologies : Java, Maven, ANTLR, Jacoco, Git
